1. List all subjects and their respective companies

SELECT s.subject_name, c.company_name
FROM subjects s
JOIN subject_companies sc ON s.subject_id = sc.subject_id
JOIN companies c ON sc.company_id = c.company_id;


2. List all subjects, along with the number of tests they've taken, who are older than 40 and work for a company with a 'One' in its name**' ||
    
SELECT s.subject_name, COUNT(t.test_id) as test_count
FROM subjects s
JOIN tests t ON s.subject_id = t.subject_id
JOIN subject_companies sc ON s.subject_id = sc.subject_id
JOIN companies c ON sc.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE s.age > 40 AND c.company_name LIKE '%One%'
GROUP BY s.subject_name;


3. List all companies and the average attention level of tests taken by subjects working for these companies
SELECT c.company_name, AVG(r.attention_level) as average_attention_level
FROM companies c
JOIN subject_companies sc ON c.company_id = sc.company_id
JOIN tests t ON sc.subject_id = t.subject_id
JOIN results r ON t.test_id = r.test_id
GROUP BY c.company_name;

4. Update the risk level of job positions to 10 if the average attention level of subjects working in these positions is below 5

UPDATE job_positions
SET risk_level = 10
WHERE position_id IN (
    SELECT jp.position_id
    FROM job_positions jp
    JOIN subjects s ON jp.company_id = s.company_id
    JOIN tests t ON s.subject_id = t.subject_id
    JOIN results r ON t.test_id = r.test_id
    GROUP BY jp.position_id
    HAVING AVG(r.attention_level) < 5
);
